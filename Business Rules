There are several existing videos that cover the MSD demo, which Paul and Lauren may find helpful as a starting point. As we currently do not have complete business context—and since we haven’t conducted any high-level MSD sessions so far—we may not be in the best position to address detailed business-related questions in a live session.

We recommend that Paul and Lauren first review the demo videos. If they have any specific questions afterward, we’d be happy to coordinate a follow-up session with Brian to address them. Additionally, we will arrange separate sessions to walk through the technical aspects of the integrations.
