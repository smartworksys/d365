Private peering, also known as private network peering or Azure Private Peering, is a networking capability offered by Microsoft Azure that allows you to establish private, high-speed, and low-latency network connections between your on-premises network and Azure virtual networks. It's a key feature of Azure ExpressRoute, which is Microsoft's dedicated, private network connection service.

Here are the key points to understand about private peering:

Dedicated Connection: Private peering provides a dedicated, private connection between your on-premises network and Azure virtual networks. This connection is not shared with other Azure customers and is not routed over the public internet.

Low Latency: Private peering offers low-latency communication between your on-premises infrastructure and resources hosted in Azure. This is important for applications that require fast and consistent network performance.

Security: Private peering is inherently more secure than public internet connections because data is transmitted over a private network connection. It is suitable for sensitive data and workloads.

Virtual Network Integration: Private peering allows you to extend your on-premises network into Azure by connecting it to one or more Azure virtual networks. This integration enables seamless communication between on-premises resources and Azure resources.

ExpressRoute: To use private peering, you typically set up an Azure ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private network connection service that connects your on-premises data centers or network to Microsoft Azure services. Private peering is one of the connectivity options available within ExpressRoute.

Routing Control: With private peering, you have control over the routing of traffic between your on-premises network and Azure. You can use your own routing equipment to manage traffic flows.

Address Space Management: You need to ensure that the IP address spaces in your on-premises network and Azure virtual networks do not overlap to avoid routing conflicts.

Connectivity Options: Azure provides various ExpressRoute options, such as Standard and Premium, each offering different features and capabilities to meet specific requirements.

Private peering is especially useful when you have strict security and compliance requirements, or when you need predictable and consistent network performance for applications hosted in Azure. It is commonly used for scenarios like hybrid cloud deployments, connecting on-premises data centers to Azure, and extending your corporate network into Azure.

Keep in mind that Azure's services and features may evolve over time, so it's essential to refer to the latest Azure documentation for the most up-to-date information and guidance on setting up private peering and ExpressRoute connections in your Azure environment.
