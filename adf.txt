Logical Architecture Considerations
Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) with Private Endpoint: SHIR is utilized for secure data movement and transformation, with a private endpoint ensuring data privacy and isolation.

Azure Integration Runtime (AIR) for SQL Server: Azure Integration Runtime is employed to establish a secure and efficient connection between the on-premises SQL Server and Dataverse, ensuring data synchronization and integration.

Express Route/Private Peering: Express Route establishes a private and dedicated network connection between the on-premises network and Azure, enhancing security and network performance.

Azure Virtual Network VM with SHIR: An Azure Virtual Network hosts a Virtual Machine (VM) running SHIR, providing a secure network environment for data integration.

Secure Data Transmission: Data is transmitted securely using HTTPS over TLS 1.2, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

Azure Key Vault Integration: Azure Key Vault is integrated for secure credential management, safeguarding client credentials used during data migration and integration.

These architectural considerations, including the inclusion of Azure Integration Runtime for SQL Server to Dataverse integration, create a robust and secure application architecture for the SQL on-premises database migration to Azure Blob Storage and Dataverse.





This application architecture document outlines the design of an application responsible for migrating an SQL on-premises database to Azure Blob Storage and Dataverse. The architecture incorporates several critical elements to ensure data security, privacy, and reliability throughout the migration process:
