# Dynamics 365 Web API Overview

The **Dynamics 365 Web API** is an **OData v4 REST service** that provides a uniform way to interact with Microsoft Dataverse (the data platform behind Dynamics 365). It exposes tables (entities), columns (attributes), and relationships in a RESTful manner, allowing you to work with Dynamics data using standard HTTP methods and OData query options.

## Key Characteristics
- **OData v4 compliant** → follows the OData (Open Data Protocol) version 4 standard.
- **RESTful interface** → CRUD operations map directly to HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Entity-centric** → each Dataverse table is an *entity set*, accessed via its plural name (e.g., `/accounts`).
- **JSON payloads** → requests and responses use JSON by default.
- **Metadata-driven** → schema, relationships, and options are discoverable via `$metadata`.

## Base URL
All requests use the organization’s service root:

```
https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2
```

- `yourorg` = your Dynamics 365 instance name.
- `v9.2` = Web API version (latest recommended).

## Authentication
- Secured by **Azure Active Directory** and requires an **OAuth 2.0 Bearer token**.
- Tokens can be obtained via **Client Credentials flow** (Client ID + Secret) for service apps, or **Authorization Code flow** for delegated user access.

## CRUD Mapping
- **Create** → `POST /<entityset>`
- **Read (Retrieve)** → `GET /<entityset>(<id>)` or `GET /<entityset>`
- **Update** → `PATCH /<entityset>(<id>)`
- **Delete** → `DELETE /<entityset>(<id>)`

## Querying Data
Supports OData system query options:
- `$select` → choose specific fields
- `$filter` → filter results server-side
- `$orderby` → sort results
- `$top` / `$skip` → paging
- `$expand` → include related entities

## Extensibility
Beyond standard CRUD, the Web API supports:
- **Bound/unbound actions** → business operations (e.g., `WinOpportunity`)
- **Functions** → read-only server logic
- **Batch requests** → multiple operations in one HTTP call
- **Annotations** → formatted values, option set labels, and metadata

⚡ **Why it matters:**  
This API enables seamless integration between Dynamics 365 and custom apps, services, portals, and automation workflows—without needing the legacy SOAP SDKs. It is the modern, future-proof way to access and manipulate Dynamics 365 data.
