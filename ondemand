- Total Available Amount: $10,562.59
- New (Renewal) Cert Minimum Balance: $50.00

Checks for "Add To" Transaction Type:

1. Check 1:
   - Condition: Check if the sum of the Current Certificate Balance and the Transaction Amount exceeds the Total Available Amount.
   - Calculation: 
     ($100.32 + $10,461.68) > $10,562.59
   - Result: This check fails because the sum ($10,562.00) does not exceed the total available amount ($10,562.59).

2. Check 2:
   - Condition: Verify if the new balance after the transaction is below the New (Renewal) Cert Minimum Balance.
   - Calculation: 
     ($100.32 + $10,461.68) < $50.00
   - Result: This check fails as the new balance ($10,562.00) is well above the minimum required balance ($50.00).
