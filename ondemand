My brother is in critical condition, and the doctors have planned a surgery early next week. My sister-in-law is donating her liver for the transplantation. My family needs me during this critical time, so I have booked my tickets for tomorrow. I will be out of the office (OOO) for two weeks and working from India for one week. Depending on the recovery, I may travel back sooner.

I am not in a state to take the interview today. Could you please assign Rejoy to take the interview in my place?
