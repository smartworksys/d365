Scenario 1: Add to Certificate
Initial Balances:

Affiliate Account Balance: 500
Current Certificate Balance: 1500
Action:

Add 1000 to the Certificate Balance.
Result:

New Certificate Balance = 1500 (current balance) + 1000 (added amount) = 2500.
Remaining Affiliate Balance = 500 (initial) - 1000 (added) = -500.
Conditions:

If Affiliate Balance - Add Amount >= 0, the result is Positive.
If Affiliate Balance - Add Amount < 0, the result is Negative.
Scenario 2: Withdraw from Certificate
Initial Balances:

Affiliate Account Balance: 500
Current Certificate Balance: 1500
Certificate Minimum Balance: 1000
Action:

Withdraw 200 from the Certificate Balance.
Result:

New Affiliate Balance = 500 (initial) + 200 (withdrawn) = 700.
New Certificate Balance = 1500 - 200 = 1300.
Condition to Check:

After withdrawal, Certificate Balance must be greater than the minimum balance:
(Current Balance - Withdrawal Amount) > Minimum Balance
Scenario 3: Specific Balance Target
Initial Balances:

Affiliate Account Balance: 500
Current Certificate Balance: 1500
Certificate Minimum Balance: 1000
Goal:

Set Certificate Balance to a specific target, e.g., 1800.
Steps:

If the target balance (1800) is greater than the current balance (1500), add the difference.
If the target balance is less than the current balance, withdraw the difference.
Examples:

1800 - 1500 = 300 → Add 300 to the Certificate.
2100 - 1500 = 600 → Add 600 to the Certificate.
1000 - 1500 = -500 → Withdraw 500 from the Certificate.
