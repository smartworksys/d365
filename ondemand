Based on my understanding, we typically do not use the HTTP action in Power Automate to POST to another flow within the same environment. Instead, we rely on the child flow functionality, which is both simpler and aligns with best practices.

Are you encountering any specific challenges when using the child flow approach? If so, Iâ€™d be happy to help troubleshoot or explore alternate solutions.
