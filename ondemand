Logic App Overview
The Logic App created for outbound write-back functionality consists of two workflows:

Ping Pathfinder
Push to Pathfinder
Workflow Details
1. Ping Pathfinder
Purpose: Verifies Pathfinder's status (up or down) and writes the result to Azure Blob Storage.
Execution: Scheduled to run every minute (near real-time).
Process:
Sends an XML payload via HTTPS to Pathfinder.
Writes the status (up/down) to a file in Azure Blob Storage.
Content Length must be calculated and included in the XML payload.
Additional Details:
The workflow name is DEVELOPMENT.
Requires environment variables:
WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATE
WEBSITE_LOAD_ROOT_CERTIFICATE
HTTPS is configured using a certificate installed on the Logic App.
Critical Note: The username and password in the payload are currently hard-coded. These should be replaced with secure retrieval from Azure Key Vault.
2. Push to Pathfinder
Purpose: Sends messages from Azure Service Bus to Pathfinder.
Execution: Runs asynchronously.
Status: Currently only a PoC (Proof of Concept) built by David. Full implementation is pending.
Process:
Reads messages from Azure Service Bus.
Sends messages to Pathfinder after verifying availability.
Azure Resource Setup
Logic App Name: KOFC-PF-PING-DEV-LAPP
Managed Identity:
Configured for the Logic App to provide secure access to:
Azure Service Bus
Application Insights
Managed Identity also allows secure retrieval of secrets from Azure Key Vault.
HTTPS Configuration:
A certificate is installed against the Logic App to enable HTTPS.
This certificate is required for Pathfinder to communicate securely over HTTPS.
Bala/Prashanth are documenting the certificate configuration.
Workflow Coordination
The workflows are designed to operate asynchronously:
Ping Pathfinder determines if Pathfinder is up or down and updates a file in Azure Blob Storage.
Push to Pathfinder depends on the status from the Ping workflow (the file in Blob Storage).
Action Items
Resource Access Transfer:

Transfer Azure resource ownership and access permissions from Will to the designated developer.
Push Workflow Completion:

Complete the implementation of the Push to Pathfinder workflow based on the PoC created by David.
Credential Security:

Replace hard-coded credentials in the Logic App payload with secure retrieval from Azure Key Vault.
Certificate Documentation:

Finalize and document the certificate configuration required for HTTPS (Bala/Prashanth).
