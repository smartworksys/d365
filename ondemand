I am canceling my out-of-office (OOO) leave for now. My brother's condition is improving with his sepsis and cirrhosis, and he has been moved from the ICU to the HDU. The doctors plan to transfer him to a regular room in a day or two, as he is now out of the life-threatening phase. My family needs my support during his liver transplantation surgery. I will postpone my OOO to a future date. The doctors mentioned it might take one to two months for the infection to completely subside and for him to reach a stable condition for surgery. He is responding well to antibiotics and showing progress.

Thank you all for your prayers and support.
