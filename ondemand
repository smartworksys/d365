As discussed, we are currently facing a blockage due to an Azure IP networking issue. Prashanth has opened a ticket with Microsoft to address this matter. Our team, in collaboration with Prashanth and Microsoft, is actively troubleshooting to resolve the issue. As a result, the development environment is not ready for demonstrations at this time. We will keep you updated on the progress and notify you once the issue is resolved.
