User Story: Configure Custom Extension for TokenIssuanceStart Event
As a developer, I want to configure a custom extension for the TokenIssuanceStart event in the Microsoft Entra Identity platform to customize claims issuance, ensuring tokens include necessary custom attributes for our application.

Acceptance Criteria:
Custom extension for TokenIssuanceStart is configured in the Azure portal.
Extension verifies and issues custom claims based on specified logic.
Proper permissions and roles are assigned to the application registration.
Testing ensures custom claims are issued successfully in tokens.
Tasks:
Research TokenIssuanceStart Event Configuration

Review the Microsoft Entra documentation on TokenIssuanceStart and clarify requirements for custom claim providers.
Document the necessary permissions and configurations.
Set Up Application Registration in Entra Identity

Register a new application (or update an existing one) in Entra Identity.
Assign the appropriate permissions for token issuance.
Define Custom Claims in the Function App

Configure the function app with logic to issue custom claims during token issuance.
Implement C# code logic for claims calculation and verification.
Test the custom claims logic locally to validate accuracy.
Configure TokenIssuanceStart Event in Azure Portal

Access the TokenIssuanceStart event configuration in the Azure portal.
Link the function app with the configured event to trigger custom claim issuance.
Validate that the event is correctly set up with the custom extension.
Set Up Permissions and Role Assignments

Ensure that the necessary role assignments are in place for the application registration.
Review and confirm that service principal permissions match requirements for token issuance.
Test Custom Claims in Tokens

Test the configuration end-to-end to verify that custom claims are issued successfully.
Confirm expected behavior by inspecting token claims for accuracy.
Document test cases and results.
Deploy and Monitor Configuration in Production

Deploy the configuration to production and monitor for any token issuance errors.
Set up logging in the function app to track custom claims issuance for troubleshooting.
This structure will guide the team through the setup, configuration, and validation phases for the custom TokenIssuanceStart extension. Let me know if any additional details are needed!
