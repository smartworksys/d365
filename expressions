User Story: Add eApp Integration Documentation to Repository README
As a developer,
I want to add eApp integration documentation to the repository README file,
So that other developers can easily understand and implement the eApp integration process.

Acceptance Criterion:

Given that the repository README file is updated with eApp integration documentation,
When a developer accesses the README,
Then they can follow a clear, step-by-step guide covering configuration, authentication, error handling, and examples of key API calls to implement eApp integration successfully.
